# seeker-ng
A Python-based GUI tool for passively scanning and displaying nearby Wi-Fi access points using airodump-ng. Built with PyQt5, designed for simplicity, portability, and touch-screen usability. The device I used was a touch screen HyperPixel display which was attached to a raspberry pi to make a portable device for scanning devices on the move.
